# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was putting together the outside of the car chasis and screwing the supprts onto it and setting up the motors. Next I did some side projects to get used to using the ESP32 and learned more about coding on Arduino. I had to download a lot of things to make sure my Arduino code would connect to the ESP32, Ardunio is a coding app which uses C++. I had a lot of trouble gettng the ESP32 to connect to my code and get my motors running but I eventually got them fixed. After I got all that set up I got to working on my motor drivers and connecting the motors to them. Along the way I had lots of issues with securely attaching the wires or pluging into the wrong ports. I plugged in all the wires and got all four motors to spin.
